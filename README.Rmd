# spectralR: Spectral reflectance visualisations for user-defined areas

## Description

This package provides tools for obtaining, processing, and visualization of spectral reflectance data for the user-defined polygons of earth surface classes, allowing to explore visually in which wavelengths the classes differ. Input should be a shapefile with polygons of surface classes (it might be polygons of different habitat types, crops, any other things). As a source of spectral reflectance data we use Sentinel2 L2A satellite mission (only optical bands), obtained through Google Earth Engine service.

The workflow depends on rgee R package, which provides a bridge between R and Python API for Google Earth Engine. All the operations with satellite imageries run in a cloud, and afterwards obtained pixel data visualize locally. Therefore, despite of extent of input data, the most resource hungry operations do not overload your local machine. But that means that you need a stable Internet connection for using API.

For using rgee you should have a Google Earth Engine account. If you don't, first register her using your Google account: https://earthengine.google.com/new_signup/

Depends on operating system you use and your current Python configuration, it may require some additional R and Python packages for running rgee. See the following links for instructions.

Quick Start User's Guide for rgee: https://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/rgee/versions/1.0.7 

Official documentation for rgee: https://r-spatial.github.io/rgee/index.html 

rgee source code: https://github.com/r-spatial/rgee

We strongly encourage you to follow official `rgee` installation guide and messages arrived during installation process.

The overall workflow is following:
1. Load user's ESRI shapefile containing polygons for user-defined surface classes, as well as the text or numerical field with classes names (labels).
2. Apply rgee functionality to retrieve multi-band pixel data for classes polygons from Google Earth Engine service.
3. Visualize retrieved pixel data locally, mainly using ggplot2 approach.

Essential requirements:
- stable Internet connection (for using API)
- Installed and correctly pre-configured Python environment (v. 3.5 or above)
- valid Google Earth Engine account

## Installation
### Install rgee and its basic dependensies
Install and set up rgee

```{r}
remotes::install_github("r-spatial/rgee")

# Load the library
library(rgee)

## It is necessary just once to complete installation necessary dependencies
ee_install()
# If something went wrong in this step, see https://r-spatial.github.io/rgee/index.html#installation

# Check non-R dependencies
ee_check() 

# rgee developers recommend installing the version of the Earth Engine Python API
# which rgge was tested with, using the following command
ee_install_upgrade()

# Initialize Google Earth Engine API
ee_Initialize()
```

If everything is OK on this step and you see a message of successful initiation of API with your GEE username in console, - congratulations, you managed to install and configure rgee!
